      <p class="question">3. How long does it take to build a website?</p>
      <div class="answer">
        <p class="font-weight-bold">
          The timeline depends on the size and complexity of the project. A
          standard website typically takes 4–8 weeks from initial consultation
          to launch. More complex projects like custom web applications may take
          longer. We’ll provide you with a detailed timeline after the project
          scope is defined.

      <div class="answer">
        <p class="font-weight-bold">
          Costs vary based on your specific needs — the number of pages, design
          complexity, special features (like e-commerce, custom forms,
          integrations), and more. After a free consultation, we’ll send you a
          personalized quote.
